# 🔒 Lock Tokens in the Vault on Devnet

This project demonstrates how to **lock SPL tokens in a vault** on the **Solana Devnet** using the **Anchor framework**.  
It simulates a vault mechanism where tokens can be **deposited and withdrawn** securely with on-chain logic.

## 🧠 Overview

- **Initialize a Vault:** Create and configure a vault PDA to store tokens.
- **Deposit Tokens:** Transfer SPL tokens from the user wallet to the vault.
- **Withdraw Tokens:** Safely release tokens back to the user.
- **Track Balances:** Observe balance changes after each operation.

All operations are executed locally on Devnet and tested through Anchor.
